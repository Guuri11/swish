A possible database design for a basketball stats app could include the following tables:

Players: This table would store information about each player, including their name, team, position, and any other relevant information.

Teams: This table would store information about each team, including their name, location, and any other relevant information.

Games: This table would store information about each game, including the teams playing, the date and time of the game, and the final score.

Player Stats: This table would store statistical information about each player's performance in a game, including points scored, rebounds, assists, and any other relevant statistics. This table would have a foreign key linking to the player and game it belongs to.

Team Stats: This table would store statistical information about each team's performance in a game, including points scored, rebounds, assists, and any other relevant statistics. This table would have a foreign key linking to the team and game it belongs to.

Users: This table would store information about the users of the app, including their name, email, and any other relevant information.

User's favorite team: This table would store information about the user's favorite team. It would have a foreign key linking to the user and team it belongs to.

User's favorite player: This table would store information about the user's favorite player. It would have a foreign key linking to the user and player it belongs to.

This is just an example of one possible design, and the specifics of the tables and their relationships will depend on the specific requirements and features of the app.
